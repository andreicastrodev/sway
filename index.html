				<p class="project-par" data-aos="fade-down">Trust in an automated system is characterized by the expectation that it will support a person in a situation characterized by uncertainty and vulnerability. It is, therefore, important to know in which situation one should rely on an intelligent function and when not to do so. If the reliability of the intelligent function is underestimated or overestimated, i.e. if it is not “calibrated” well enough, this leads to distrust or overtrust, and incorrect interaction with the system as a result.
				</p>

				<p class="project-par" data-aos="fade-down">Reliability displays are intended to provide information on the reliability of intelligent system functions and thus to align expectations with actual system capabilities. They provide the user with an opportunity to adapt their own acceptance- and trust-related attitude to a system function.
				</p>

				<p class="project-par" data-aos="fade-down">The aim of CALIBRaiTE is to join trust calibration via reliability displays and AI-based systems by apply this approach to predictive systems in the Building Information Modeling (BIM) context. In the project, a predictive BIM-UI is expanded with reliability indicators based on reliability requirements from domain experts. The indicators will undergo an evaluation and the resulting solutions will be captured as Design Patterns for reliability indicators.
				</p>

				<p class="project-par" data-aos="fade-down">The importance and contribution of CALIBRaiTE is they made people trust and rely on automations based only on their needs and avoid vulnerability, CALIBRaiTE used displays and AI-based systems by apply this approach to predictive systems in the Building Information Modeling (BIM) context.

				<p class="project-par" data-aos="fade-down">The Center for Human-Computer Interaction is part of a consortium in the Horizon2020 project HADRIAN. In this project we are dealing with the question how the interaction of drivers in semi-automated vehicles can be made safe.


				</p>

				<p class="project-par" data-aos="fade-down">The HADRIAN project (short for Holistic Approach for Driver Role Integration and Automation Allocation for European Mobility) is a project funded by the European Union. It involves 16 partners from science and industry from 9 countries (Austria, Germany, Spain, Greece, France, Slovenia, Netherlands, Turkey, Great Britain). Project partners include Virtual Vehicles, Ford, ASFINAG and universities from Athens, Granada, Surrey and Delft. The project started in December 2019 and has a duration of 42 months.

				</p>

				<p class="project-par" data-aos="fade-down">Highly automated driving promises more safety together with a multitude of previously unimagined possibilities, such as less stress and more meaningful activities while driving. However, the introduction and implementation of automated driving has so far fallen short of these promises. This is partly due to the fact that there is not yet sufficient research on how drivers interact with automated vehicles
				</p>

				<p class="project-par" data-aos="fade-down">The overall goal of the project is to come closer to the “Vison Zero” (no traffic fatalities) of the European Union.

				<p class="project-par" data-aos="fade-down">The FFG funded project Digital Motion is a joint effort of 4 scientific and 12 industrial partners under the lead of Salzburg Research. DiMo aims to to give people a better understanding of their physical activity by linking motion and emotion, leading to an overall new (digital) experience. In order to reach that ambitious goal, the project consortium is compound of researchers from data science, kinesiology, psychophysiology,  and human computer interaction as well as leading sports industry partners.




				</p>

				<p class="project-par" data-aos="fade-down">In this project we as the Center for Human-Computer Interaction focus our research on meaningful, unobtrusive ways for the real-time communication of and interaction with qualitative motion data while in locomotion with the ultimate goal to enrich the user experience rather than distracting the athlete. Furthermore we will be heavily involved in the conception, design and development of motion data demonstrators for field trials.

				</p>



				<p class="project-par" data-aos="fade-down">Digital Motion envisions to become one of Europe’s leading R&D projects in the field of Digital Sports. For the first time, DiMo facilitates the link between motion and emotion enabled through the next generation of smart sports equipment

				<p class="project-par" data-aos="fade-down"> The project aims not only at improving autonomous transport on a technical level but also explore service models for and interaction with passengers as well as communication of an automated vehicle with other road users. To this end, the Center for HCI is involved in prototyping, design, and evaluation activities for both inside- and outside-interaction with the Digibus ® Austria. Apart from dedicated laboratory environments, the Digibus® will be operated on a public test track in Koppl, Austria along with a public showcase at the Lower Austria Regional Exhibition 2019.

				<p class="project-par" data-aos="fade-down">MMAssist II is a national flagship project funded through the FFG and its Production of the future call series. The consortium consists of 25 partners from industry and academia. The project is coordinated by PROFACTOR GmbH and the scientific lead is with the Center for HCI.
				</p>

				<p class="project-par" data-aos="fade-down"> The goal of MMAssist II is to explore the fundamentals and characteristics of assistance in production contexts. Based on this, optimized assistance systems for future work places focused on the human worker („Human-Centered Workplace“) will be developed, implemented and evaluated in industrial environments. Basis for the implementation are so called „Assistance Units“ – which are modular components for assistance systems. Assistance Units are defined in a way that they can be applied to different application contexts. The partners will implement a software framework with which Assistance Units can be dynamically configured to act as assistance system for a given application.
				</p>



				<p class="project-par" data-aos="fade-down">As scientific lead, the Center for HCI is responsible for coordinating the scientific activities between all partners. As experts in the field of Human-Computer Interaction, we are responsible for detecting, investigating and monitoring the user requirements of the developed assistance systems. Intensive user studies in real-world shop floor environments will be performed to ensure the developed system meets the needs of the targeted user groups. Over the project duration, we will be also responsible for tracking the human-centered implementation through evaluating the developed prototypes in the lab and in the field.
